class BaseMemoryStorage(ABC):
    r"""An abstract base class for memory-based storage systems. This class is
    designed to handle memory operations with support for user contexts, memory
    persistence, and advanced querying capabilities.

    The class provides a foundation for implementing memory storage systems that
    can:
    1. Store and retrieve memories with context (user, agent, session)
    2. Support both long-term and short-term memory management
    3. Enable semantic search and filtering of memories
    4. Handle structured data with metadata
    5. Support batch operations for memory management

    This class is meant to be inherited by implementations that provide memory
    storage capabilities, such as Mem0, vector databases with memory features,
    or custom memory management systems.
