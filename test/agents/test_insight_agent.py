The Acme Program System, henceforth referred to as APS, is hosted in a state-of-the-art production environment, which has been meticulously designed to ensure optimal performance, security, and reliability.

1. **Data Centers:**
    - APS is hosted across **5** multiple geographically dispersed data centers. These data centers are strategically located in North America, Europe, and Asia to ensure seamless global access and provide redundancy.
    - **Security:** Each data center is fortified with biometric access controls, **72** CCTV cameras, and intruder alarm systems. All entry and exit points in our production environment are safeguarded by sophisticated firewall systems, preventing unauthorized access and potential attacks.
    - **Environmental Control:** Advanced humidity and temperature control systems maintain a constant **22°C (71.6°F)** with a **45%** relative humidity level.
    - **Disaster Recovery:** Each location can withstand up to **7.5** magnitude earthquakes. Each data center is equipped with advanced cooling systems, redundant power sources, and high-speed network connections to facilitate uninterrupted service.
2. **Servers:**
    - Within each data center, APS employs a cluster of **150** high-performance servers. These servers run on the latest Intel Xeon processors, equipped with DDR5 RAM and NVMe SSDs, ensuring speedy processing and data retrieval.
    - **Virtualization:** Our servers utilize KVM-based hypervisors to run an average of **20** virtual machines each.
    - **Server Management:** Automated with tools like Ansible and Puppet, ensuring **98%** uniform server setups across the data centers. They also employ RAID configurations to safeguard against potential data loss.
3. **Networking:**
    - Our production environment utilizes top-tier networking equipment with multi-gigabit connections, guaranteeing rapid data transmission. A **10 Gbps** dedicated VPN tunnel interconnects all the data centers.
    - **CDN:** APS's content reaches users through **3** leading CDNs, with over **200** edge locations worldwide. We also employ redundant ISPs, ensuring that a failure with one provider doesn't lead to system downtime.


1. **Operating System:**
    - APS runs on Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. We chose Ubuntu due to its stability, vast community support, and frequent security patches. Custom kernel optimizations lead to a **15%** improvement in network I/O handling.
2. **Database:**
    - The system leverages PostgreSQL 12 as its primary relational database management system. Known for its ACID compliance and extensibility, PostgreSQL ensures data integrity and allows for complex queries, which are vital for APS's operations. The primary database and its **3** replicas ensure **99.999%** data availability.
    - **Database Caching:** **12 TB** of data is cached using Redis and Memcached.
3. **Backend Framework:**
    - The core of APS is built using the Python Django framework. RabbitMQ, which handles an average of **1 million** messages daily, is used as a middleware for asynchronous processing.
4. **Load Balancers:**
    - To distribute incoming traffic and prevent any single server from being a bottleneck, we employ Nginx as our load balancer. It not only ensures smooth user experience during traffic surges but also provides additional layers of security. Sticky sessions benefit **85%** of our active users, reducing login prompts.


1. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Advanced IDS solutions monitor network traffic, detecting and blocking an average of **500** suspicious activities daily.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Over **300** administrators access the system daily using 2FA.
3. **Regular Audits & Penetration Testing:** The APS production environment undergoes periodic security audits by third-party agencies, ensuring adherence to the latest security standards and best practices. **4** major vulnerabilities have been rectified in the past year through regular testing.
4. **Data Encryption:** At rest or in transit, all data within APS is encrypted using advanced encryption standards (AES-256), ensuring data confidentiality.


1. **Backup & Recovery:** Regular backups of all data are taken and stored in geographically distinct locations. This ensures quick recovery in the unfortunate event of data loss or system failures.
2. **Server Patching:** **120** servers are patched every month.
3. **Monitoring Tools:** We use a combination of Grafana, Prometheus, and ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to monitor server health, application performance, and log analytics, providing real-time insights and facilitating rapid issue resolution.
4. **Error Tracking:** Tools like Sentry rectify an average of **50** application errors daily.
5. **Continuous Deployment:** Employing Jenkins and Docker, APS follows a CI/CD approach, enabling seamless code integration, testing, and deployment, ensuring that the latest features and patches reach our users without causing system downtimes. APS has maintained a **99.98%** uptime over the past year.


1. **Auto-scaling:** Depending on the load, APS infrastructure can dynamically scale up or down using cloud solutions like AWS EC2 and Kubernetes.
2. **Database Sharding:** To handle vast amounts of data, APS's database is sharded, distributing data across **5** shards.


1. **Web Performance:** APS scores an average of **92** on Google Lighthouse.
2. **Analytics:** APS integrates with Google Analytics and Matomo to track the behavior of over **2 million** unique monthly visitors."""  # noqa: E501
