            "   - **Superposition**: Particles exist in multiple states until measured.\n",

            "   - **Create a Justification**: Prepare a concise argument for why \"the pursuit of equality\" is a more fitting phrase. Emphasize its relevance to the ideals of the Revolution and its potential impact on future governance.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Execution Phase**:\n",
            "   - **Timing**: Choose a moment just before the signing ceremony when the delegates are gathered for final discussions. This is typically when they would be reviewing the document and making last-minute adjustments.\n",
            "   - **Approach the Chosen Signer**: Casually engage the selected signer in conversation about the Declaration. Use this opportunity to introduce the idea of altering the phrase.\n",
            "     - Example Dialogue: \"As we stand on the brink of a new nation, might it not be more fitting to declare our commitment to equality alongside life and liberty? The pursuit of equality could resonate more deeply with future generations.\"\n",
            "   - **Gauge Support**: If the chosen signer shows interest, encourage them to bring it up in the group discussion. If they seem hesitant, offer to present the idea as a suggestion from them, ensuring it appears as a collective thought rather than a personal agenda.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Group Discussion**:\n",
            "   - **Introduce the Change**: If the signer agrees, they can propose the alteration during the final review of the document. They should frame it as a minor adjustment to enhance the document's clarity and intent.\n",
            "   - **Encourage Consensus**: Highlight the importance of unity among the signers. Emphasize that this change reflects the collective aspirations of the colonies and could strengthen the Declaration's impact.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Follow-Up Phase**:\n",
            "   - **Monitor Reactions**: After the proposal, observe the reactions of other signers. If there is resistance, be prepared to support the argument with historical examples of the importance of equality in governance.\n",
            "   - **Document the Change**: Ensure that the altered phrase is included in the final version of the Declaration. If necessary, discreetly assist in making the change in the document before it is officially signed.\n",

            "5. **Return Protocol**:\n",
