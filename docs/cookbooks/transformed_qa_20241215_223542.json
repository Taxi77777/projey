    "input": "",
    "output": "To find the coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\), we can use the Binomial Theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can identify \\( a = \\frac{3}{5}x \\) and \\( b = -\\frac{y}{2} \\), and \\( n = 8 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\nWe need to find the coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion. This means we need to determine which terms in the expansion will yield \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y^6 \\).\n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\n1. Identify the values of \\( k \\) and \\( n-k \\) such that the resulting powers of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are \\( 2 \\) and \\( 6 \\), respectively.\n2. Use the Binomial Theorem to find the specific term corresponding to those values.\n3. Calculate the coefficient of that term.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\n1. **Determine \\( k \\) and \\( n-k \\)**:\n   - The term \\( a^{n-k} \\) contributes to the power of \\( x \\).\n   - The term \\( b^k \\) contributes to the power of \\( y \\).\n   - We want \\( (n-k) \\) such that \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{n-k} = x^2 \\) implies \\( n-k = 2 \\).\n   - We want \\( k \\) such that \\( \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k = y^6 \\) implies \\( k = 6 \\).\n\n   Since \\( n = 8 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   n - k = 2 \\implies 8 - k = 2 \\implies k = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the term**:\n   The term in the expansion corresponding to \\( k = 6 \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the coefficient**:\n   - Calculate \\( \\binom{8}{6} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{9}{25}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{6} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\frac{1}{64}\n     \\]\n\n   Now combine these:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Coefficient} = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64}\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate:\n   \\[\n   28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{252}{25}\n   \\]\n   Now multiply by \\( \\frac{1}{64} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{252}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{252}{1600}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying \\( \\frac{252}{1600} \\):\n   - The GCD of 252 and 1600 is 4.\n   - Dividing both by 4:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{252 \\div 4}{1600 \\div 4} = \\frac{63}{400}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Final Answer\nThe coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]"

    "output": "To solve the problem of how many times the letter \"r\" appears in the word \"strawberry,\" we can follow the outlined steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\nThe problem requires us to count the occurrences of the letter \"r\" in the word \"strawberry.\" This involves:\n- Identifying the target letter, which is \"r.\"\n- Understanding that we need to look at the entire word to find all instances of this letter.\n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\nTo solve the problem, we can break it down into the following steps:\n1. Write down the word \"strawberry.\"\n2. Examine each letter in the word.\n3. Count how many times the letter \"r\" appears in the word.\n4. Summarize the findings to provide the final count.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\nNow, let's execute the steps we have outlined:\n\n1. **Write down the word**: The word we are analyzing is \"strawberry.\"\n2. **Examine each letter**: We will look at each letter in the word:\n   - s\n   - t\n   - r\n   - a\n   - w\n   - b\n   - e\n   - r\n   - r\n   - y\n3. **Count the occurrences of \"r\"**:\n   - The first \"r\" is the 3rd letter.\n   - The second \"r\" is the 8th letter.\n   - The third \"r\" is the 9th letter.\n   - Therefore, we find that \"r\" appears **three times** in the word \"strawberry.\"\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Final Answer\nAfter counting the occurrences of the letter \"r,\" we conclude that the letter \"r\" appears **3 times** in the word \"strawberry.\"\n\n### Final Answer\nThe letter \"r\" appears **3 times** in the word \"strawberry.\""
