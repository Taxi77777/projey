    "input": "",
    "output": "To find the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\), we can use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can identify \\(a = \\frac{3}{5}x\\) and \\(b = -\\frac{y}{2}\\), and \\(n = 8\\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\nWe need to find the specific term in the expansion that contains \\(x^2y^6\\). This means we need to determine the values of \\(k\\) and \\(n-k\\) such that:\n\n- The power of \\(x\\) is 2.\n- The power of \\(y\\) is 6.\n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\n1. Identify the general term in the expansion using the Binomial Theorem.\n2. Set up the equation to find \\(k\\) such that the term contains \\(y^6\\).\n3. Calculate the corresponding \\(n-k\\) to find the power of \\(x\\).\n4. Substitute \\(k\\) and \\(n-k\\) into the general term to find the coefficient.\n5. Simplify the coefficient to express it as a common fraction.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\n1. The general term in the expansion is given by:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\n2. We want the term where the power of \\(y\\) is 6. Since \\(y\\) appears in the term \\((-y/2)^k\\), we set \\(k = 6\\).\n\n3. Now, we calculate \\(n-k\\):\n\n\\[\nn - k = 8 - 6 = 2\n\\]\n\nThis means we will have \\(x^2\\) in our term, which is what we want.\n\n4. Substitute \\(k = 6\\) and \\(n-k = 2\\) into the general term:\n\n\\[\nT_6 = \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6}\n\\]\n\n5. Calculate each part:\n\n- The binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\n- The power of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} x^{2} = \\frac{9}{25} x^{2}\n\\]\n\n- The power of \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\left(-1\\right)^{6} \\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{y^6}{64} = \\frac{y^6}{64}\n\\]\n\n6. Combine these parts to find the coefficient of the term:\n\n\\[\nT_6 = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{y^6}{64} \\cdot x^2\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 9}{25 \\cdot 64}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n\\[\n28 \\cdot 9 = 252\n\\]\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n\n\\[\n25 \\cdot 64 = 1600\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{252}{1600}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Final Answer\nNow, we simplify \\(\\frac{252}{1600}\\):\n\nThe greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 1600 is 4. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4 gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{252 \\div 4}{1600 \\div 4} = \\frac{63}{400}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]"
