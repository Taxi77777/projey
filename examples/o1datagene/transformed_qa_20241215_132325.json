    "input": "",
    "output": "To find the coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\), we will use the Binomial Theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can identify \\( a = \\frac{3}{5}x \\) and \\( b = -\\frac{y}{2} \\), and \\( n = 8 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem requirements\nWe need to find the specific term in the expansion that corresponds to \\( x^2y^6 \\). This means we need to determine the values of \\( k \\) and \\( n-k \\) such that:\n- The power of \\( x \\) is 2\n- The power of \\( y \\) is 6\n\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\n1. Identify the general term in the binomial expansion.\n2. Set up equations based on the powers of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n3. Solve for \\( k \\) and \\( n-k \\).\n4. Substitute \\( k \\) back into the general term to find the coefficient.\n5. Simplify the coefficient to express it as a common fraction.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\n1. The general term in the expansion is given by:\n   \\[\n   T_k = \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\n   \\]\n\n2. We need to find \\( k \\) such that:\n   - The power of \\( x \\) is \\( 8-k = 2 \\) (which means \\( k = 6 \\))\n   - The power of \\( y \\) is \\( k = 6 \\)\n\n3. Since both conditions lead to \\( k = 6 \\), we can proceed to find the coefficient for this term.\n\n4. Substitute \\( k = 6 \\) into the general term:\n   \\[\n   T_6 = \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6}\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate \\( \\binom{8}{6} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n   \\]\n\n6. Now compute \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} = \\frac{9}{25}x^2\n   \\]\n\n7. Compute \\( \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\left(-1\\right)^{6} \\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\frac{y^6}{64}\n   \\]\n\n8. Now combine these to find \\( T_6 \\):\n   \\[\n   T_6 = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} x^2 \\cdot \\frac{y^6}{64}\n   \\]\n\n9. Simplify the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Coefficient} = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 9}{25 \\cdot 64}\n   \\]\n\n10. Calculate \\( 28 \\cdot 9 = 252 \\) and \\( 25 \\cdot 64 = 1600 \\):\n    \\[\n    \\text{Coefficient} = \\frac{252}{1600}\n    \\]\n\n11. Simplify \\( \\frac{252}{1600} \\):\n    - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 1600 is 4.\n    - Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4 gives:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{252 \\div 4}{1600 \\div 4} = \\frac{63}{400}\n    \\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\nThe coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]"

    "input": "",
    "output": "To solve the problem of how many times the letter \"r\" appears in the word \"strawberry,\" we will follow the outlined requirements step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\nThe problem requires us to count the occurrences of the letter \"r\" in the word \"strawberry.\" This is a straightforward counting problem where we need to identify each instance of the specified letter within the given word.\n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\n1. Identify the word we are analyzing, which is \"strawberry.\"\n2. Break down the word into its individual letters.\n3. Count how many times the letter \"r\" appears in the list of letters.\n4. Provide the final count as the answer.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\n1. The word we are analyzing is \"strawberry.\"\n2. Breaking down the word into individual letters, we get:\n   - s\n   - t\n   - r\n   - a\n   - w\n   - b\n   - e\n   - r\n   - r\n   - y\n3. Now, we will count the occurrences of the letter \"r\":\n   - In the breakdown, we see:\n     - The first letter is \"s\" (not \"r\")\n     - The second letter is \"t\" (not \"r\")\n     - The third letter is \"r\" (count = 1)\n     - The fourth letter is \"a\" (not \"r\")\n     - The fifth letter is \"w\" (not \"r\")\n     - The sixth letter is \"b\" (not \"r\")\n     - The seventh letter is \"e\" (not \"r\")\n     - The eighth letter is \"r\" (count = 2)\n     - The ninth letter is \"r\" (count = 3)\n     - The tenth letter is \"y\" (not \"r\")\n   - Total count of \"r\" = 3.\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Final Answer\nThe final answer to the question \"how many r in strawberry?\" is **3**. \n\n### Thought Process Summary\n- We began by understanding the requirement to count a specific letter in a word.\n- We systematically broke down the word into its letters to facilitate counting.\n- We carefully counted each occurrence of the letter \"r\" and confirmed the total.\n- Finally, we presented the count as the solution to the problem."
