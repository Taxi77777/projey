    "output": "To find the coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\), we will follow a systematic approach. \n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem requirements\nWe need to expand the expression \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\) and identify the coefficient of the term \\( x^2y^6 \\). This involves using the binomial theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, \\( a = \\frac{3}{5}x \\), \\( b = -\\frac{y}{2} \\), and \\( n = 8 \\).\n\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\n1. Identify the general term in the binomial expansion.\n2. Determine the values of \\( k \\) that yield the desired powers of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n3. Calculate the coefficient for the identified term.\n4. Simplify the coefficient to express it as a common fraction.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\n1. **Identify the general term**: The general term in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\n2. **Determine the values of \\( k \\)**: We want the term where the power of \\( x \\) is 2 and the power of \\( y \\) is 6. From the general term:\n\n- The power of \\( x \\) is \\( 8 - k \\).\n- The power of \\( y \\) is \\( k \\).\n\nSetting these equal to the desired powers:\n\n\\[\n8 - k = 2 \\quad \\text{(for } x^2\\text{)}\n\\]\n\\[\nk = 6 \\quad \\text{(for } y^6\\text{)}\n\\]\n\nFrom \\( 8 - k = 2 \\), we find \\( k = 6 \\). This means we will use the term corresponding to \\( k = 6 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the coefficient for \\( k = 6 \\)**:\n\nSubstituting \\( k = 6 \\) into the general term:\n\n\\[\nT_6 = \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n- The binomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\n- The \\( x \\) term:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} x^{2} = \\frac{9}{25} x^{2}\n\\]\n\n- The \\( y \\) term:\n\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{6} y^{6} = \\frac{1}{64} y^{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, combine these results:\n\n\\[\nT_6 = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} x^{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} y^{6}\n\\]\n\n4. **Combine the coefficients**:\n\nCalculating the coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient} = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 9}{25 \\cdot 64}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 28 \\cdot 9 = 252 \\) and \\( 25 \\cdot 64 = 1600 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient} = \\frac{252}{1600}\n\\]\n\nNow, simplify \\( \\frac{252}{1600} \\):\n\nBoth 252 and 1600 can be divided by 4:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{252 \\div 4}{1600 \\div 4} = \\frac{63}{400}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\nThe coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]"

    "input": "",
    "output": "To solve the problem of how many times the letter \"r\" appears in the word \"strawberry,\" we will follow the outlined steps carefully.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\nThe problem requires us to count the occurrences of the letter \"r\" in the word \"strawberry.\" This involves:\n- Identifying the specific letter we are counting (in this case, \"r\").\n- Understanding that we need to look at the entire word to find all instances of this letter.\n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\nTo solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:\n1. Write down the word \"strawberry.\"\n2. Examine each letter in the word one by one.\n3. Count how many times the letter \"r\" appears as we go through the letters.\n4. Summarize the total count of \"r\" at the end.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\nNow, let's execute the steps we outlined:\n\n1. **Write down the word**: The word is \"strawberry.\"\n2. **Examine each letter**:\n   - s\n   - t\n   - r (1st occurrence)\n   - a\n   - w\n   - b\n   - e\n   - r (2nd occurrence)\n   - r (3rd occurrence)\n   - y\n\n3. **Count the occurrences**:\n   - As we go through the letters, we find:\n     - The first \"r\" is in the 3rd position.\n     - The second \"r\" is in the 8th position.\n     - The third \"r\" is in the 9th position.\n   - Therefore, we have counted a total of 3 occurrences of the letter \"r.\"\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Final Answer\nAfter counting the occurrences of the letter \"r\" in the word \"strawberry,\" we find that the letter \"r\" appears **3 times**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe letter \"r\" appears **3 times** in the word \"strawberry.\""
