    "input": "",
    "output": "To find the coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\), we can use the Binomial Theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can identify \\( a = \\frac{3}{5}x \\) and \\( b = -\\frac{y}{2} \\), and \\( n = 8 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem requirements\nWe need to find the specific term in the expansion that contains \\( x^2y^6 \\). This means we need to determine the values of \\( k \\) and \\( n-k \\) such that:\n- The power of \\( x \\) is 2.\n- The power of \\( y \\) is 6.\n\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\n1. Identify the general term in the binomial expansion.\n2. Set up equations based on the powers of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n3. Solve for \\( k \\) and \\( n-k \\).\n4. Substitute \\( k \\) into the general term to find the coefficient.\n5. Simplify the coefficient to express it as a common fraction.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\n1. **Identify the general term**:\n   The general term in the expansion is given by:\n   \\[\n   T_k = \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up equations**:\n   We want \\( (8-k) \\) to equal 2 (for \\( x^2 \\)) and \\( k \\) to equal 6 (for \\( y^6 \\)):\n   \\[\n   8 - k = 2 \\implies k = 6\n   \\]\n   This means we are looking for the term where \\( k = 6 \\).\n\n3. **Substitute \\( k \\) into the general term**:\n   Now we substitute \\( k = 6 \\) into the general term:\n   \\[\n   T_6 = \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the binomial coefficient and powers**:\n   - Calculate \\( \\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{9}{25} \\).\n   - Calculate \\( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\frac{1}{64} \\).\n\n5. **Combine everything**:\n   Now we can combine these results:\n   \\[\n   T_6 = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} \\cdot x^2 \\cdot y^6\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 9}{25 \\cdot 64}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the coefficient**:\n   Calculate \\( 28 \\cdot 9 = 252 \\) and \\( 25 \\cdot 64 = 1600 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{252}{1600}\n   \\]\n   Now simplify \\( \\frac{252}{1600} \\):\n   - The GCD of 252 and 1600 is 4.\n   - Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4 gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{63}{400}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\nThe coefficient of \\( x^2y^6 \\) in the expansion of \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]"

    "instruction": "how many r in strawberry?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "To solve the problem of how many times the letter \"r\" appears in the word \"strawberry,\" we will follow the outlined steps carefully.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\nThe problem requires us to count the occurrences of the letter \"r\" in the word \"strawberry.\" This involves understanding the structure of the word and identifying each character within it. \n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\n1. Identify the word we need to analyze, which is \"strawberry.\"\n2. Break down the word into its individual characters.\n3. Count how many times the letter \"r\" appears in the list of characters.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\n1. **Identify the word**: The word is \"strawberry.\"\n2. **Break down the word into characters**: The characters in \"strawberry\" are:\n   - s\n   - t\n   - r\n   - a\n   - w\n   - b\n   - e\n   - r\n   - r\n   - y\n3. **Count the occurrences of \"r\"**: \n   - Looking at the characters, we can see:\n     - The first character is 's' (not 'r')\n     - The second character is 't' (not 'r')\n     - The third character is 'r' (count 1)\n     - The fourth character is 'a' (not 'r')\n     - The fifth character is 'w' (not 'r')\n     - The sixth character is 'b' (not 'r')\n     - The seventh character is 'e' (not 'r')\n     - The eighth character is 'r' (count 2)\n     - The ninth character is 'r' (count 3)\n     - The tenth character is 'y' (not 'r')\n   - Total count of 'r' = 3\n\n### Step 4: Provide the Final Answer\nThe final answer is that the letter \"r\" appears **3 times** in the word \"strawberry.\"\n\n### Summary of Thought Process\n- We started by clearly defining the task: counting occurrences of a specific letter.\n- We systematically broke down the word into its individual letters to ensure we didn't miss any occurrences.\n- We carefully counted each instance of the letter \"r\" and confirmed our count.\n- Finally, we presented the answer in a clear and concise manner."
