    "input": "",
    "output": "To find the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\), we can use the Binomial Theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can identify \\(a = \\frac{3}{5}x\\) and \\(b = -\\frac{y}{2}\\), and \\(n = 8\\). We need to find the specific term in the expansion that contains \\(x^2y^6\\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem requirements\nWe need to find the term in the expansion that corresponds to \\(x^2y^6\\). This means we need to determine how many times we choose \\(a\\) and how many times we choose \\(b\\) in the expansion.\n\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\n1. Identify the powers of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the term we are looking for.\n2. Set up the equation based on the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) chosen.\n3. Use the Binomial Theorem to find the coefficient of the term.\n4. Calculate the specific values and simplify.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\n1. **Identify the powers**: We want \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^6\\). This means we need \\(a\\) to contribute \\(x^2\\) and \\(b\\) to contribute \\(y^6\\).\n   - Since \\(a = \\frac{3}{5}x\\), we need to choose \\(a\\) twice (because \\((\\frac{3}{5}x)^2\\) gives \\(x^2\\)).\n   - Since \\(b = -\\frac{y}{2}\\), we need to choose \\(b\\) six times (because \\((- \\frac{y}{2})^6\\) gives \\(y^6\\)).\n\n2. **Set up the equation**: The total number of terms chosen must equal \\(n\\):\n   \\[\n   k + (n-k) = 8 \\quad \\text{where } k \\text{ is the number of } b's.\n   \\]\n   Here, we have \\(k = 6\\) (for \\(b\\)) and \\(n-k = 2\\) (for \\(a\\)). This checks out since \\(6 + 2 = 8\\).\n\n3. **Use the Binomial Theorem**: The term we are interested in is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6}\n   \\]\n   We can calculate each part:\n   - The binomial coefficient:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n     \\]\n   - The power of \\(a\\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} x^{2} = \\frac{9}{25} x^{2}\n     \\]\n   - The power of \\(b\\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\left(-1\\right)^{6} \\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{y^6}{64} = \\frac{y^6}{64}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine everything**:\n   Now we can combine these results:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Term} = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} \\cdot x^2 y^6\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 9}{25 \\cdot 64}\n   \\]\n   Calculating the numerator:\n   \\[\n   28 \\cdot 9 = 252\n   \\]\n   And the denominator:\n   \\[\n   25 \\cdot 64 = 1600\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{252}{1600}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the fraction**:\n   To simplify \\(\\frac{252}{1600}\\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 1600. The GCD is 4.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{252 \\div 4}{1600 \\div 4} = \\frac{63}{400}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\nThe coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]"
