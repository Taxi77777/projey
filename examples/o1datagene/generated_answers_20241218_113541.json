    "What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8$?  Express your answer as a common fraction": "To find the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\), we can use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can identify \\(a = \\frac{3}{5}x\\) and \\(b = -\\frac{y}{2}\\), and \\(n = 8\\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem requirements\nWe need to find the specific term in the expansion that corresponds to \\(x^2y^6\\). This means we need to determine the values of \\(k\\) and \\(n-k\\) such that:\n\n- The power of \\(x\\) is 2\n- The power of \\(y\\) is 6\n\n### Step 2: List the steps to solve the problem\n1. Identify the general term in the binomial expansion.\n2. Set up the equations based on the powers of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n3. Solve for \\(k\\) and \\(n-k\\).\n4. Substitute \\(k\\) into the general term to find the coefficient.\n5. Simplify the coefficient to express it as a common fraction.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the solution process\n1. **Identify the general term**: The general term in the expansion is given by:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\binom{8}{k} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\n2. **Set up the equations**:\n   - From \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{8-k}\\), the power of \\(x\\) is \\(8-k\\).\n   - From \\(\\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k\\), the power of \\(y\\) is \\(k\\).\n   - We want \\(8-k = 2\\) (for \\(x^2\\)) and \\(k = 6\\) (for \\(y^6\\)).\n\n3. **Solve for \\(k\\)**:\n   - From \\(8-k = 2\\), we find \\(k = 6\\).\n   - This is consistent with our requirement for \\(y\\) since \\(k = 6\\).\n\n4. **Substitute \\(k\\) into the general term**:\n   - Now we can substitute \\(k = 6\\) into the general term:\n\n\\[\nT_6 = \\binom{8}{6} \\left(\\frac{3}{5}x\\right)^{2} \\left(-\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^{6}\n\\]\n\n5. **Calculate the coefficient**:\n   - First, calculate \\(\\binom{8}{6}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\n   - Now calculate \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2}\\) and \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{6}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{9}{25}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n\n   - Now combine these:\n\n\\[\nT_6 = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n\n   - Calculate the coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient} = 28 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{28 \\cdot 9}{25 \\cdot 64} = \\frac{252}{1600}\n\\]\n\n6. **Simplify the fraction**:\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{252}{1600}\\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 252 and 1600. The GCD is 4.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{252 \\div 4}{1600 \\div 4} = \\frac{63}{400}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Provide the final answer\nThus, the coefficient of \\(x^2y^6\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}x - \\frac{y}{2}\\right)^8\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{63}{400}}\n\\]",
    "how many r in strawberry?": "To solve the problem of how many times the letter \"r\" appears in the word \"strawberry,\" we will follow the outlined requirements step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\nThe problem requires us to count the occurrences of the letter \"r\" in the word \"strawberry.\" This is a straightforward counting problem where we need to identify each instance of the specified letter within the given word.\n\n### Step 2: List the Steps to Solve the Problem\nTo solve the problem, we can break it down into the following steps:\n1. Identify the word we are analyzing, which is \"strawberry.\"\n2. Examine each letter in the word to check if it is the letter \"r.\"\n3. Keep a count of how many times we encounter the letter \"r.\"\n4. Return the final count.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Solution Process\nNow, we will execute the steps outlined above:\n\n1. The word we are analyzing is \"strawberry.\"\n2. We will examine each letter in \"strawberry\":\n   - s\n   - t\n   - r (1st occurrence)\n   - a\n   - w\n   - b\n   - e\n   - r (2nd occurrence)\n   - r (3rd occurrence)\n   - y\n3.
