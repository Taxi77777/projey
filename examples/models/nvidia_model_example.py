Here is a sample code for a simple trading bot written in Python:

import ccxt
import time

# Initialize the exchange
exchange = ccxt.binance({
    'apiKey': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
   'secret': 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
})

# Define the trading parameters
symbol = 'BTC/USDT'
amount = 0.001
buy_price = 50000
sell_price = 55000

# Place a buy order
order = exchange.create_market_buy_order(symbol, amount)
print("Buy order placed at", order['price'])

# Wait for the order to be filled
while True:
    order_status = exchange.fetch_order(order['id'], symbol)
    if order_status['status'] == 'closed':
        break
    time.sleep(1)

# Place a sell order
order = exchange.create_market_sell_order(symbol, amount)
print("Sell order placed at", order['price'])

# Wait for the order to be filled
while True:
    order_status = exchange.fetch_order(order['id'], symbol)
    if order_status['status'] == 'closed':
        break
    time.sleep(1)

This code uses the ccxt library to interact with the Binance exchange.
You will need to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your 
own API keys in order to run this code. 
This code is just a simple example and is not intended 
for actual trading.
