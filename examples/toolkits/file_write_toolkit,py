================================================================
I have generated a simple Python script for analyzing word 
frequency in a text, and the code has been saved to the 
file `word_frequency_analysis.py`. The script uses the 
`collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each word
after removing punctuation and converting the text to 
lowercase. It also includes a `main` function that demonstrates
how to use the `word_frequency` function with a sample text.

Here is the content of the script:

```python
from collections import Counter

import re

def word_frequency(text):
    # Remove punctuation and make lowercase
    text = re.sub(r"\W", " ", text.lower())
    # Split into words
    words = text.split()
    # Count the frequency of each word
    freq = Counter(words)
    return freq

def main():
    test_text = "Hello world. Hello again, this is 
    a simple text to analyze word frequency."
    print(word_frequency(test_text()))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

The future is a concept that fascinates everyone. As we think 
about the future, we often wonder what advances in technology 
will shape our world. The future holds endless possibilities, 
from exploration of distant planets to the integration of 
artificial intelligence in our daily lives. Preparing for 
the future requires us to innovate and adapt. Many believe 
that the future is bright, with opportunities for growth and 
progress, while others advocate for a more cautious approach.
Regardless, the future remains a topic of 
great interest and discussion.
