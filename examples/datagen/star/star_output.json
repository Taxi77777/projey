We start by noting that $p^2 - 1$ can be factored as $(p-1)(p+1)$.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 8**: \n   - Since $p$ is a prime and $p \\geq 5$, $p$ is odd. Therefore, both $p-1$ and $p+1$ are even.\n   - Since $p-1$ and $p+1$ are consecutive even numbers, one of them is divisible by $4$. Hence, their product $(p-1)(p+1)$ is divisible by $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n3. **Divisibility by 3**: \n   - Since $p$ is a prime greater than $3$, it is not divisible by $3$.

      "solution": "1. **Identify the positions**: Let's denote the cowboy's initial position as point $C$, the stream as a horizontal line to the north of $C$, and the cabin as point $B$.

The reflected point is \\((x + 8, 11)\\).\n\n#### Step 2: Find the Straight-Line Distance\nThe shortest path from the cowboy \\((x, -4)\\) to the stream and then to the cabin is equivalent to the straight-line distance from the cowboy \\((x, -4)\\) to the reflected cabin \\((x + 8, 11)\\).\n\nUsing the distance formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x + 8 - x)^2 + (11 - (-4))^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + 15^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 225} = \\sqrt{289} = 17.\n\\]\n\nThus, the shortest total distance the cowboy can travel is **17 miles**.\n\n---\n\n### **4.

So, \\( E \\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \\( BC \\).\n\nSince \\( BC = 12 \\), the midpoint of \\( BC \\) is 6 units from both \\( B \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nLet's denote the midpoint of \\( BC \\) as \\( M \\). So, \\( BM = MC = 6 \\).\n\nSince \\( E \\) is equidistant from \\( B \\) and \\( C \\), \\( E \\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \\( BC \\), which is a line perpendicular to \\( BC \\) at point \\( M \\).\n\nLet's assume the line \\( ABCD \\) is horizontal for simplicity, and \\( E \\) is somewhere above or below this line.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system to make this easier.\n\n**Setting Up Coordinates:**\n\nLet's place point \\( B \\) at the origin, so \\( B = (0, 0) \\).\n\nThen, \\( C \\) is 12 units to the right of \\( B \\), so \\( C = (12, 0) \\).\n\nPoint \\( A \\) is to the left of \\( B \\), and \\( AB = x \\), so \\( A = (-x, 0) \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( D \\) is to the right of \\( C \\), and \\( CD = x \\), so \\( D = (12 + x, 0) \\).\n\nPoint \\( E \\) is not on the line \\( ABCD \\), and \\( BE = CE = 10 \\).\n\nSince \\( E \\) is equidistant from \\( B \\) and \\( C \\), it lies on the perpendicular bisector of \\( BC \\). The midpoint \\( M \\) of \\( BC \\) is at \\( (6, 0) \\).\n\nThe perpendicular bisector is a vertical line passing through \\( M \\), so \\( E \\) has coordinates \\( (6, y) \\), where \\( y \\) is the vertical distance from the line \\( ABCD \\).\n\nWait, \\( E \\) could be above or below the line, but since distance is positive, \\( y \\) can be positive or negative, but the distance \\( |y| \\) will be the same.\n\nGiven that \\( BE = 10 \\), and \\( B = (0, 0) \\), \\( E = (6, y) \\), the distance \\( BE \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(6 - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + y^2} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{36 + y^2} = 10 \\\\\n36 + y^2 = 100 \\\\\ny^2 = 64 \\\\\ny = \\pm 8\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( E \\) is at \\( (6, 8) \\) or \\( (6, -8) \\). Since the problem doesn't specify, we can assume \\( E \\) is at \\( (6, 8) \\) for simplicity.\n\n**Coordinates Summary:**\n\n- \\( A = (-x, 0) \\)\n- \\( B = (0, 0) \\)\n- \\( C = (12, 0) \\)\n- \\( D = (12 + x, 0) \\)\n- \\( E = (6, 8) \\)\n\n**Calculating Distances:**\n\nNow, we need to find \\( AE \\) and \\( ED \\).\n\nFirst, \\( AE \\):\n\n\\[\nAE = \\sqrt{(6 - (-x))^2 + (8 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(6 + x)^2 + 64}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\( ED \\):\n\n\\[\nED = \\sqrt{(6 - (12 + x))^2 + (8 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(-6 - x)^2 + 64} = \\sqrt{(6 + x)^2 + 64}\n\\]\n\nWait, \\( AE = ED \\)? That's interesting.\n\nSo, \\( AE = ED = \\sqrt{(6 + x)^2 + 64} \\).\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\n\\[\nAE + ED = 52 - 2x\n\\]\n\nBut since \\( AE = ED \\), let's denote \\( AE = ED = d \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nd + d = 52 - 2x \\\\\n2d = 52 - 2x \\\\\nd = 26 - x\n\\]\n\nBut \\( d = \\sqrt{(6 + x)^2 + 64} \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(6 + x)^2 + 64} = 26 - x\n\\]\n\nNow, we can square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[\n(6 + x)^2 + 64 = (26 - x)^2\n\\]\n\nLet's expand both sides.\n\nFirst, \\( (6 + x)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n(6 + x)^2 = 36 + 12x + x^2\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( (26 - x)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n(26 - x)^2 = 676 - 52x + x^2\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n36 + 12x + x^2 + 64 = 676 - 52x + x^2\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms on the left:\n\n\\[\n36 + 64 = 100 \\\\\n100 + 12x + x^2 = 676 - 52x + x^2\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( x^2 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n100 + 12x = 676 - 52x\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\):\n\nAdd \\( 52x \\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n100 + 12x + 52x = 676 \\\\\n100 + 64x = 676\n\\]\n\nSubtract 100 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n64x = 576\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 64:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{576}{64} = 9\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( AB = x = 9 \\).\n\n**Verifying the Answer:**\n\nWait, let's check if this makes sense.\n\nWe found \\( AB = 9 \\). Let's see if this satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nGiven \\( AB = CD = 9 \\), and \\( BC = 12 \\), so \\( AD = AB + BC + CD = 9 + 12 + 9 = 30 \\).\n\nPoint \\( E \\) is at \\( (6, 8) \\), and \\( BE = CE = 10 \\), which we already used to find \\( E \\).\n\nNow, the perimeter of \\( \\triangle BEC \\) is \\( BE + EC + BC = 10 + 10 + 12 = 32 \\).\n\nThe perimeter of \\( \\triangle AED \\) should be twice that, so \\( 2 \\times 32 = 64 \\).\n\nLet's calculate \\( AE \\) and \\( ED \\) with \\( x = 9 \\):\n\n\\[\nAE = \\sqrt{(6 + 9)^2 + 64} = \\sqrt{225 + 64} = \\sqrt{289} = 17\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\( ED = 17 \\).\n\nSo, the perimeter of \\( \\triangle AED \\) is \\( AE + ED + AD = 17 + 17 + 30 = 64 \\), which matches the condition.\n\nTherefore, \\( AB = 9 \\) is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe length of \\( AB \\) is \\( \\boxed{9} \\).",
