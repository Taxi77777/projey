The car travels to city B at 60 km/h and returns to city A at 40 km/h. The total time for the journey is 5 hours.\n\n2. **Breaking it Down**: \n   - Let's call the distance between the two cities \"d\" (in kilometers).\n   - The time taken to travel from A to B at 60 km/h is d/60 hours.\n   - The time taken to return from B to A at 40 km/h is d/40 hours.\n   - The total time for the journey is the sum of these two times, which equals 5 hours.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation**: \n   - So, we can write the equation: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{60} + \\frac{d}{40} = 5\n     \\]\n   - Now, I think we need to find a common denominator to combine the fractions. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120. \n\n4. **Rewriting the Fractions**: \n   - We can rewrite the equation with a common denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{60} = \\frac{2d}{120} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{d}{40} = \\frac{3d}{120}\n     \\]\n   - So, the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2d}{120} + \\frac{3d}{120} = 5\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5d}{120} = 5\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solving for d**: \n   - Now, if I multiply both sides by 120 to get rid of the fraction, I think it would look like this:\n     \\[\n     5d = 5 \\times 120\n     \\]\n   - So, that would be:\n     \\[\n     5d = 600\n     \\]\n   - Now, if I divide both sides by 5 to solve for d:\n     \\[\n     d = \\frac{600}{5} = 120\n     \\]\n\n6. **Verifying the Solution**: \n   - The distance between the two cities is 120 km. \n   - Now, let's check the times:\n     - Time from A to B: \\( \\frac{120}{60} = 2 \\) hours.\n     - Time from B to A: \\( \\frac{120}{40} = 3 \\) hours.\n   - Adding these times gives \\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\) hours, which matches the total time given in the problem.\n\nSo, I think the distance between city A and city B is **120 km**.

Show all steps and explain why each step is valid.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe need to prove that if \\( n^2 \\) (the square of a positive integer \\( n \\)) is even, then \\( n \\) itself must also be even. This involves understanding the definitions of even and odd integers.\n\n### Step 2: Define Key Concepts\n1. **Even Integer:** An integer is **even** if it can be expressed as \\( 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n2. **Odd Integer:** An integer is **odd** if it can be expressed as \\( 2k + 1 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 3: Use Contrapositive\nTo prove the statement, we can use the contrapositive approach. The contrapositive of the statement \"if \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) is even\" is \"if \\( n \\) is odd, then \\( n^2 \\) is odd.\" Proving this contrapositive will also prove the original statement.\n\n### Step 4: Assume \\( n \\) is Odd\nAssume \\( n \\) is odd. By definition, we can express \\( n \\) as:\n\\[\nn = 2k + 1\n\\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 5: Calculate \\( n^2 \\)\nNow, we calculate \\( n^2 \\):\n\\[\nn^2 = (2k + 1)^2\n\\]\nExpanding this using the distributive property:\n\\[\nn^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\n\\]\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\\[\nn^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\n\\]\nThis shows that \\( n^2 \\) can be expressed in the form \\( 2m + 1 \\) where \\( m = 2k^2 + 2k \\). Since \\( m \\) is an integer, this means \\( n^2 \\) is odd.\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the Contrapositive\nSince we have shown that if \\( n \\) is odd, then \\( n^2 \\) is odd, we have successfully proved the contrapositive statement. This is a valid logical step because proving the contrapositive of a statement is equivalent to proving the original statement.\n\n### Step 7: Final Conclusion\nBy proving the contrapositive, we conclude that if \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) must be even. This completes the proof. Therefore, we can confidently state that the original statement is true.\n\n### Summary\nIn this reasoning process, we defined key concepts, used a logical approach through the contrapositive, made algebraic manipulations, and clearly stated our conclusions. The structured transitions between steps enhance clarity and ensure that the proof is both correct and easy to follow. \n\nThis improved explanation addresses the feedback by explicitly stating the completion of the proof and reiterating the implications of the contrapositive, making the reasoning clearer and more concise.",

We need to find out how long it will take for the tank to fill up completely.\n\n### Step 2: Break it Down\n1. **Calculate the volume of the tank**: We need to find out how much water the tank can hold when it's full.\n2. **Calculate the net flow rate of water**: Since water is both flowing in and draining out, we need to find the effective rate at which the tank is filling up.\n3. **Calculate the time to fill the tank**: Using the volume of the tank and the net flow rate, we can find out how long it will take to fill it.\n\n### Step 3: Solve Each Part\n\n#### Part 1: Calculate the Volume of the Tank\nThe formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\nWhere:\n- \\( r \\) is the radius,\n- \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( r = 3 \\) meters,\n- \\( h = 4 \\) meters,\n- \\( \\pi = 3.14 \\).\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\\[ V = 3.14 \\times (3^2) \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ = 3.14 \\times 9 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ = 3.14 \\times 36 \\]\n\\[ = 113.04 \\text{ cubic meters} \\]\n\nSo, the volume of the tank is **113.04 cubic meters**.\n\n#### Part 2: Calculate the Net Flow Rate\nWater is flowing into the tank at 2 cubic meters per minute and draining at 1 cubic meter per minute. The net flow rate \\( R \\) is:\n\\[ R = \\text{Inflow} - \\text{Outflow} \\]\n\\[ R = 2 - 1 = 1 \\text{ cubic meter per minute} \\]\n\nSo, the net flow rate is **1 cubic meter per minute**.\n\n#### Part 3: Calculate the Time to Fill the Tank\nNow we can find out how long it will take to fill the tank using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Volume}}{\\text{Net Flow Rate}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{113.04}{1} = 113.04 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, it will take **113.04 minutes** to fill the tank completely.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Solution\nLet's double-check:\n- The volume of the tank was calculated as 113.04 cubic meters.\n- The net flow rate was calculated as 1 cubic meter per minute.\n- The time to fill the tank was calculated as 113.04 minutes.\n\nEverything seems to check out correctly. \n\n### Conclusion\nIt will take approximately **113.04 minutes** to fill the tank completely.",

Let's tackle this step by step, even though I might not be the best at explaining things clearly.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe have two equations:\n1. \\( 2x - 3y = 7 \\)\n2. \\( 4x + y = 13 \\)\n\nWe need to find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy both equations at the same time. This is called solving a system of equations.\n\n### Step 2: Break It Down\nWe can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I think elimination might be easier here, but I might get confused, so let\u2019s try it.\n\n### Step 3: Solve Each Part\nFirst, let's manipulate the equations to eliminate one variable. \n\nFrom the second equation \\( 4x + y = 13 \\), we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n\\[ y = 13 - 4x \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for \\( y \\) into the first equation \\( 2x - 3y = 7 \\):\n\\[ 2x - 3(13 - 4x) = 7 \\]\n\nNow, let's distribute the -3:\n\\[ 2x - 39 + 12x = 7 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 14x - 39 = 7 \\]\n\nNext, we add 39 to both sides:\n\\[ 14x = 46 \\]\n\nNow, divide by 14:\n\\[ x = \\frac{46}{14} \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ x = \\frac{23}{7} \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( x \\), we can find \\( y \\) using the expression we found earlier:\n\\[ y = 13 - 4\\left(\\frac{23}{7}\\right) \\]\n\nCalculating \\( 4 \\times \\frac{23}{7} \\):\n\\[ 4 \\times \\frac{23}{7} = \\frac{92}{7} \\]\n\nNow substitute this back into the equation for \\( y \\):\n\\[ y = 13 - \\frac{92}{7} \\]\n\nTo combine these, we need a common denominator. The number 13 can be expressed as:\n\\[ 13 = \\frac{91}{7} \\]\n\nSo now we have:\n\\[ y = \\frac{91}{7} - \\frac{92}{7} = \\frac{91 - 92}{7} = \\frac{-1}{7} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Solution\nNow we have \\( x = \\frac{23}{7} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{-1}{7} \\).

This version will focus on clarity and precision in each step of the induction process.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe want to prove that \\(3^n > n^2 + 2\\) for all integers \\(n \\geq 3\\). This means we need to show that the exponential function \\(3^n\\) grows faster than the polynomial function \\(n^2 + 2\\) as \\(n\\) increases.\n\n### Step 2: Outline the Induction Process\nMathematical induction consists of two main components:\n1. **Base Case**: Verify the statement for the initial value \\(n = 3\\).\n2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement is true for some integer \\(k\\) (the inductive hypothesis) and then show that it must also be true for \\(k + 1\\).\n\n### Step 3: Execute Each Part\n\n#### Base Case\nWe start with the base case for \\(n = 3\\):\n- Calculate \\(3^3\\) and \\(3^2 + 2\\):\n  \\[\n  3^3 = 27\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3^2 + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11\n  \\]\n- Compare the two results:\n  \\[\n  27 > 11\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the base case holds true.\n\n#### Inductive Step\nNext, we assume the statement is true for \\(n = k\\), where \\(k \\geq 3\\). This means we assume:\n\\[\n3^k > k^2 + 2\n\\]\nWe need to show that this implies:\n\\[\n3^{k+1} > (k+1)^2 + 2\n\\]\n\nFirst, express \\(3^{k+1}\\):\n\\[\n3^{k+1} = 3 \\cdot 3^k\n\\]\nUsing our inductive hypothesis, we substitute \\(3^k\\):\n\\[\n3^{k+1} > 3(k^2 + 2)\n\\]\nNow we need to show:\n\\[\n3(k^2 + 2) > (k+1)^2 + 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand the right side:\n\\[\n(k+1)^2 + 2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 + 2 = k^2 + 2k + 3\n\\]\nSo we need to prove:\n\\[\n3(k^2 + 2) > k^2 + 2k + 3\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side gives:\n\\[\n3k^2 + 6 > k^2 + 2k + 3\n\\]\nNow, rearranging this inequality:\n\\[\n3k^2 + 6 - k^2 - 2k - 3 > 0\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k^2 - 2k + 3 > 0\n\\]\n\n#### Verification of the Inequality\nNow we need to check if \\(2k^2 - 2k + 3 > 0\\) for \\(k \\geq 3\\). \n\nTo analyze the quadratic \\(2k^2 - 2k + 3\\):\n- The discriminant \\(D\\) of the quadratic is given by:\n  \\[\n  D = b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 4 - 24 = -20\n  \\]\nSince the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots and opens upwards (as the coefficient of \\(k^2\\) is positive). Therefore, \\(2k^2 - 2k + 3\\) is always positive for all \\(k\\).\n\nTo confirm this, we can check specific values:\n- For \\(k = 3\\):\n  \\[\n  2(3^2) - 2(3) + 3 = 18 - 6 + 3 = 15 > 0\n  \\]\n- For \\(k = 4\\):\n  \\[\n  2(4^2) - 2(4) + 3 = 32 - 8 + 3 = 27 > 0\n  \\]\n- As \\(k\\) increases, the quadratic will remain positive.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince both the base case and the inductive step hold true, we conclude that by mathematical induction, \\(3^n > n^2 + 2\\) for all integers \\(n \\geq 3\\). \n\nThis reasoning is now clearer, with explicit transitions between steps and a thorough verification of the inequalities, addressing the feedback provided.

This means we need to show that as \\(n\\) increases, the exponential function \\(3^n\\) grows faster than the polynomial function \\(n^2 + 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Break Down the Induction Process\nMathematical induction consists of two main parts:\n1. **Base Case**: Verify the statement for the initial value \\(n = 3\\).\n2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement is true for some integer \\(k\\) (the inductive hypothesis) and then show that it must also be true for \\(k + 1\\).\n\n### Step 3: Solve Each Part\n\n#### Base Case\nWe check the base case for \\(n = 3\\):\n- Calculate \\(3^3\\) and \\(3^2 + 2\\):\n  \\[\n  3^3 = 27\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3^2 + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11\n  \\]\n- Compare the two results:\n  \\[\n  27 > 11\n  \\]\n- Thus, the base case holds true.\n\n#### Inductive Step\nNow, we assume the statement is true for \\(n = k\\), where \\(k \\geq 3\\). This means we assume:\n\\[\n3^k > k^2 + 2\n\\]\nWe need to show that this implies:\n\\[\n3^{k+1} > (k+1)^2 + 2\n\\]\n\nFirst, express \\(3^{k+1}\\):\n\\[\n3^{k+1} = 3 \\cdot 3^k\n\\]\nUsing our inductive hypothesis, we substitute \\(3^k\\):\n\\[\n3^{k+1} > 3(k^2 + 2)\n\\]\nNow we need to show:\n\\[\n3(k^2 + 2) > (k+1)^2 + 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand the right side:\n\\[\n(k+1)^2 + 2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 + 2 = k^2 + 2k + 3\n\\]\nSo we need to prove:\n\\[\n3(k^2 + 2) > k^2 + 2k + 3\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side gives:\n\\[\n3k^2 + 6 > k^2 + 2k + 3\n\\]\nNow, rearranging this inequality:\n\\[\n3k^2 + 6 - k^2 - 2k - 3 > 0\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2k^2 - 2k + 3 > 0\n\\]\n\n#### Verification of the Inequality\nNow we need to check if \\(2k^2 - 2k + 3 > 0\\) for \\(k \\geq 3\\). \n\nTo analyze the quadratic \\(2k^2 - 2k + 3\\):\n- The discriminant \\(D\\) of the quadratic is given by:\n  \\[\n  D = b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 4 - 24 = -20\n  \\]\nSince the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots and opens upwards (as the coefficient of \\(k^2\\) is positive). Therefore, \\(2k^2 - 2k + 3\\) is always positive for all \\(k\\).\n\nTo confirm this, we can check specific values:\n- For \\(k = 3\\):\n  \\[\n  2(3^2) - 2(3) + 3 = 18 - 6 + 3 = 15 > 0\n  \\]\n- For \\(k = 4\\):\n  \\[\n  2(4^2) - 2(4) + 3 = 32 - 8 + 3 = 27 > 0\n  \\]\n- As \\(k\\) increases, the quadratic will remain positive.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince both the base case and the inductive step hold true, we conclude that by mathematical induction, \\(3^n > n^2 + 2\\) for all integers \\(n \\geq 3\\). \n\nThis reasoning is clearer and ensures that each step is justified, addressing the feedback provided.",
