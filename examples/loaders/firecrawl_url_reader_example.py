Camel-AI Team
We are finding the  
scaling law of agent
=========================================
üê´ CAMEL is an open-source library designed for the study of autonomous and 
communicative agents. We believe that studying these agents on a large scale 
offers valuable insights into their behaviors, capabilities, and potential 
risks. To facilitate research in this field, we implement and support various 
types of agents, tasks, prompts, models, and simulated environments.
**We are** always looking for more **contributors** and **collaborators**.
