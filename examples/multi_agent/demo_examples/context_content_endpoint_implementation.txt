### 1. Development Environment
At XYZ Corporation, we utilize an extensive system of microservices for our back-end infrastructure using Python's Flask framework. Recently, a new microservice was developed for handling customer invoices. However, it currently lacks an endpoint to fetch invoice details by invoice_id from a PostgreSQL table named customer_invoices. This table uses invoice_id as its primary key. The required endpoint should have the format /get-invoice/<invoice_id>, and if the invoice is found, it should return details in JSON format with a 200 status code. Conversely, if not found, a 404 status code with an appropriate message should be returned, ensuring efficient database querying without unnecessary load.
