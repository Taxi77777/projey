- **Current Bots**: We have a few basic trading bots in place, mainly for forex trading, based on predefined strategies like MACD crossovers and Bollinger Bands.

### **Objective of the New Trading Bot:**
The new trading bot should be able to:
1. Analyze large datasets in real-time, including stock prices, news feeds, and social media sentiments.
2. Make buy/sell decisions based on a mix of predefined strategies and adaptive AI algorithms.
3. Automatically adjust its strategies based on market conditions (e.g., bull markets, bear markets, high volatility).
4. Provide a user-friendly interface where traders can set their risk levels, investment amounts, and other preferences.
5. Offer simulation modes for back-testing strategies.
