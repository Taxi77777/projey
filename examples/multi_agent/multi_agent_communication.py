However, it currently lacks an endpoint to fetch invoice details by invoice_id from a PostgreSQL table named customer_invoices. This table uses invoice_id as its primary key. The required endpoint should have the format /get-invoice/<invoice_id>, and if the invoice is found, it should return details in JSON format with a 200 status code.
