The objective of this project is to study how an AI society would function, behave, and interact through communicating with each other. This framework will enable the simulation of communication between agents playing different roles, such as a user seeking help on a particular task, and a domain expert eager to provide assistance. The tasks that agents will collaborate on could vary from complex problem-solving to creative story generation. This project provides easy and flexible framework for communicating agents. 

Overall, this project has the potential to open up new possibilities for collaboration between machines. By simulating communication between agents, we can gain insights into how AI could function in society and identify areas for improvement. Ultimately, this research could have far-reaching implications for the development of intelligent systems and the future of AI.
